# Internet Connectivity Investment Plan for Remote Schools in Rwanda

## Executive Summary
This document outlines a strategic plan to connect schools in remote areas of Rwanda to the internet, prioritizing efficiency and impact. By analyzing population density, isolation index, recommended technologies, and cost estimates, we propose targeted investments that will maximize the benefit to students and communities. The initial budget allocated for this initiative is $23,500.00. The recommendations are designed to optimize the use of this budget to achieve the highest possible impact.

## Key Recommendations

| School Name     | Population Density | Isolation Index | Technology | Investment ($) | Rationale                                                                 |

| ECD MBUGANGARI  | 12,357             | 3              | Cellular   | 5,876          | Cost covers installation within a densely populated area.                |
| E.P KARIYERI    | 3,966              | 7              | Cellular   | 3,517          | Cost reflects the installation in a moderately populated area.            |
| EP KARAMA       | 3,504              | 7              | Cellular   | 1,000          | Cost is minimal as it is close to an existing tower.                     |
| EP RUBONA       | 1,479              | 0              | Cellular   | 6,694          | Cost covers the installation in a remote, isolated area.                  |
| EP KARIYERI     | 1,328              | 3              | Cellular   | 1,000          | Cost is minimal as it is close to an existing tower.                     |
| EP GURIRO       | 1,317              | 2              | Cellular   | 1,000          | Cost is minimal as it is close to an existing tower.                     |
| G.S KARAMBI     | 968                | 6              | Cellular   | 2,519          | Cost reflects the installation in a sparsely populated area.               |
| GS GITARAGA     | 958                | 1              | Cellular   | 1,000          | Cost is minimal as it is close to an existing tower.                     |

## Methodology
- **Data Sources**: The dataset was processed to assess population density, isolation index, available technologies, and estimated costs.
- **Decision Criteria**:
  - High population density prioritized for greater impact.
  - Low isolation index identified to reduce disparities.
  - Recommended technologies chosen based on feasibility and cost.

## Prioritized Action Plan
1. **Immediate Investments**: Allocate funds to connect ECD MBUGANGARI, E.P KARIYERI, and EP RUBONA within the next fiscal quarter. These schools have the highest population densities and isolation indices, ensuring maximum impact.
2. **Long-term Strategies**: Develop partnerships with tech providers for sustainable solutions and consider additional investments based on ongoing budget allocations.

## Next Steps
- Finalize agreements with technology vendors.
- Schedule implementation phases to ensure timely execution.
- Monitor the impact of the investments and adjust the strategy as needed based on ongoing assessments and new data.
