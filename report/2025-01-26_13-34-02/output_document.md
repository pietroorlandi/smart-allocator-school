# Internet Connectivity Investment Plan for Remote Schools in Rwanda

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a strategic plan to connect schools in remote areas of Rwanda to the internet, prioritizing efficiency and impact. By analyzing population density, isolation index, recommended technologies, and cost estimates, we propose targeted investments that will maximize the benefit to students and communities. The recommendations are based on a dataset processed to assess various factors, including the closest available connectivity infrastructure and estimated implementation costs.

## Key Recommendations

| School ID | Population Density | Isolation Index | Technology | Investment ($) | Rationale                                                                 |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 4         | 180                 | 0.4             | Cellular   | 100            | The closest cellular tower is 0.3541 km away, making it a cost-effective solution for this area. |
| 1         | 200                 | 0.5             | Broadband  | 600            | The closest cellular tower is 0.2157 km away, but the estimated cost includes installation and maintenance for broadband. |
| 2         | 150                 | 0.3             | Broadband  | 700            | The closest broadband service point is 11.5951 km away, requiring significant investment for FTTH technology. |

## Methodology

- **Data Sources**: The dataset was processed to assess population density, isolation index, available technologies, and estimated costs.
- **Decision Criteria**:
  - Higher population density prioritized for greater impact.
  - Lower isolation index identified to reduce disparities.
  - Recommended technologies chosen based on feasibility and cost.

## Prioritized Action Plan

1. **Immediate Investments**: Allocate funds to connect School ID 4 within the next fiscal quarter. This will provide immediate connectivity to a school with a population density of 180 and an isolation index of 0.4.
2. **Long-term Strategies**: Develop partnerships with tech providers for sustainable solutions. Consider connecting School ID 1 and School ID 2 in subsequent phases, focusing on areas with higher population density and slightly higher isolation indices.

## Next Steps

- Finalize agreements with technology vendors.
- Schedule implementation phases to ensure timely execution.
- Monitor the impact of the investments on connectivity and educational outcomes in the target schools.

## Additional Information

- **Remaining Budget**: There is a remaining budget of $100 after the immediate investment in School ID 4. This can be allocated to ongoing maintenance and support for the connected schools or used for additional small-scale projects to enhance connectivity in other areas.
